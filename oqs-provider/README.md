# A Qompass implementation of the Open Quantum Safe provider for OpenSSL (3.x)

## Purpose

This repository contains code to enable quantum-safe cryptography (QSC)
in a standard OpenSSL (3.x) distribution by way of implementing a single
shared library. All of the heavy work was done by the great folks
of the Open-Quantum-Safe Project and NIST. We're humbled
to stand on the shoulders of such giants.

## Status

Currently this provider fully enables quantum-safe cryptography for KEM
key establishment in TLS1.3 including management of such keys via the
OpenSSL (3.0) provider interface and hybrid KEM schemes. Also, QSC
signatures including CMS and CMP functionality are available via the OpenSSL
EVP interface. Key persistence is provided via the encode/decode mechanism,
X.509 data structures, and PKCS#12 for bundling a private key with its
corresponding X.509 certificate. Starting with OpenSSL 3.2 support for
TLS1.3 signature functionality is available and final glitches for CMS
have been resolved.

The standards implemented are documented in the separate file [STANDARDS.md](STANDARDS.md).

## Algorithms

<!--- OQS_TEMPLATE_FRAGMENT_ALGS_END -->

As the underlying [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs)
at build time may be configured to not enable all algorithms, it is
advisable to check the possible subset of algorithms actually enabled
via the standard commands, i.e.,
`openssl list -signature-algorithms -provider oqsprovider` and
`openssl list -kem-algorithms -provider oqsprovider`.

In addition, algorithms not denoted with "\*" above are not enabled for
TLS operations. This designation [can be changed by modifying the
"enabled" flags in the main algorithm configuration file](CONFIGURE.md#pre-build-configuration).

In order to support parallel use of classic and quantum-safe cryptography
this provider also provides different hybrid algorithms, combining classic
and quantum-safe methods.
There are two types of combinations:
The Hybrids are listed above with a prefix denoting a classic algorithm, e.g., for elliptic curve: "p256\_".
The [Composite](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs/) are listed above with a suffix denoting a
classic algorithm, e.g., for elliptic curve: "\_p256".

A full list of algorithms, their interoperability code points and OIDs as well
as a method to dynamically adapt them, e.g., for interoperability testing are
documented in [ALGORITHMS.md](ALGORITHMS.md).

## Building and testing -- Very Quick start

\*\*The below scripts used with a lack of knowledge or thoughtful preparation with OpenSSL, Cryptography,
and processor architecture have high potential of bricking your system. All building scripts
have been established using the isolated /opt directory native to Linux/Unix systems
with numerous checks on dependendcies that trigger the build stopping. All of this
was done to contain and mitigate the potential of bricking your box.
YMMV.

```bash
# in the KO/oqs-provider directory after KO
## Used liboqs 0.11, oqs-provider 0.7.0 and openssl 3.4.0
./gambit.sh
```

## For OpenSSL 3.0/3.1

In these versions, CMS functionality implemented in providers is not
supported: The resolution of https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/17717
has not been not getting back-ported to OpenSSL3.0.

Also not supported in this version are provider-based signature algorithms
used during TLS1.3 operations as documented in https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/10512.

Also not fully supported in 3.0.2 is performance testing as per the openssl
`speed` command as documented in #385.

## For OpenSSL 3.2 and greater

These versions have full support for all TLS1.3 operations using PQ algorithms
when deploying `oqsprovider`, particularly with regard to the use of signature
algorithms.

## 3.4 and greater

These versions are expected to support the `openssl pkeyutl -encap/-decap`
syntax for testing key encapsulation and decapsulation for test purposes. To
use this option, OQS provider should be built with
[KEM encoding/decoding support](CONFIGURE.md#oqs_kem_encoders).
Also new in this version is the possibility to retrieve all currently
active TLS signature algorithms via a new `openssl list` option:
`openssl list -tls-signature-algorithms`.

## All versions

A limitation present in older OpenSSL versions is the number of default groups
supported: [At most 44 default groups may be specified](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/23624)
, e.g., passing to [SSL_CTX_set1_groups](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man3/SSL_CTX_set1_groups.html).
Therefore caution is advised activating all KEMs supported by `oqsprovider`
via [the pre-build configuration facility](CONFIGURE.md#pre-build-configuration):
This may lead to `openssl` crashing, depending on the OpenSSL version used:
The problem is gone in OpenSSL "master" branch and in the respective branches
since the releases 3.3.0, 3.2.2., 3.1.6 and 3.0.14.

For [general OpenSSL implementation limitations, e.g., regarding provider feature usage and support,
see here](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man7/migration_guide.html).

A problem basically related to any TLS server installation is the observed
[limitation to 64 TLS signature algorithms](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/399)
by some TLS server implementations. Therefore, again caution is advised
[activating more than 64 PQ signature algorithms via the pre-build configuration facility](CONFIGURE.md#pre-build-configuration).

## Standards compliance

This project follows the [NIST PQC standardization process](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography)
and aims to support experimentation with the various PQC algorithms
under evaluation and in different stages of standardization by NIST.
`oqsprovider` at this time cannot claim or prove adherence to any
standards documents published. For more details, review the file
[STANDARDS.md](STANDARDS.md) carefully. Most notably, hybrid and
composite implementations exclusively implemented in `oqsprovider`
are at a pre-standard/draft stage only. Over time the project aims
to provide standards compliance and solicits input by way of
contributions to achieve this state.

## Component disclaimer

`oqsprovider` for the implementation of all pure PQC functionality
is completely dependent on [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) and accordingly
cannot recommend any use beyond experimentation purposes:

WE DO NOT CURRENTLY RECOMMEND RELYING ON THIS SOFTWARE IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT OR TO PROTECT ANY SENSITIVE DATA. This software is meant to help with research and prototyping. While we make a best-effort approach to avoid security bugs, this library has not received the level of auditing and analysis that would be necessary to rely on it for high security use.
