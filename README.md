## Abstract

### Title
K.O.: Kyber Ontology of post quantum encryption for a post CrowdStrike Healthcare System.

### Background
The deeply unfortunate events of the Crowdstrike faulty patch on July 19, 2024 crippled global healthcare systems.

### Methods
We developed a secure virtual environment that implements hybrid post-quantum encryption protocol of NIST post-quantum finalist Kyber1024 with X25519 Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange.

### Results
[Add comparison results between Kyber and other methods]

### Conclusion
We propose that our hybrid encryption protocol is a safe, secure, trustworthy and [complete the conclusion].
