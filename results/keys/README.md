# Kyber Odyssey Use Case: Securing Personal Health Data in the Age of AI

One of our most pressing challenges is securing data at restâ€”the files stored on personal devices like laptops & phones.
In this example, **phi.pdf** represents a fictional patient record, illustrating how sensitive health information is vulnerable to cyber threats.
To protect against potential attacks, **encrypted_phi.pdf** is an encrypted version of the same file, secured directly on the device.

The purpose of this encryption is to combat the threat of the "harvest now, decrypt later" approach used by malicious actors, who aim to gather and decrypt sensitive data at some point in the future.

## How to Download

- [phi.pdf](./phi.pdf): Click here to view or download the unencrypted patient record.
- [encrypted_phi.pdf](./encrypted_phi.pdf): Click here to **download** the encrypted version.
  **Note:** Encrypted files cannot be viewed directly online like unencrypted ones.
