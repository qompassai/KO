# Securing Personal Health Data in the Age of AI

One of our most pressing challenges is securing data at restâ€”the files stored on
personal devices like laptops. In this example, **phi.pdf** represents a fictional
patient record, illustrating how sensitive health information is vulnerable to cyber
threats. To protect against potential attacks, **encrypted_phi.pdf** is an encrypted
version of the same file, secured directly on the device.

The critical importance of securing data at rest is highlighted by the 2024 Change
Healthcare cyberattack, where threat actors exfiltrated up to 4TB of sensitive
healthcare data, reportedly affecting **one in three** Americans.

This encryption specifically addresses the "harvest now, decrypt later" strategy
employed by malicious actors who collect encrypted data today, anticipating that
future AI & computing capabilities will enable them to decrypt it. By implementing
strong encryption practices now, we protect sensitive information against both
current and future threats.
