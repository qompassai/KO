# Securing Personal Health Data in the age of AI

- One of our most acute use cases is securing data at rest, ie the files on your laptop.
- The phi.pdf is an example fictional patient record vulnerable to hackers.
- The encrypted_phi.pdf is the same phi.pdf file encrypted by us on device.

The goal is to mitigate the `harvest now, decrypt later` practice of bad actors
on sensitive health data.

## How to download without having to download any other data

- [phi.pdf](./phi.pdf): Click to view or download `phi.pdf`.
