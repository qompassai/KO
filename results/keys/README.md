# Securing Personal Health Data in the Age of AI

One of our most pressing challenges is securing data at rest—the files stored on
personal devices like laptops. In this example, **phi.pdf** represents a fictional
patient record, illustrating how sensitive health information is vulnerable to cyber
threats. To protect against potential attacks, **encrypted_phi.pdf** is an encrypted
version of the same file, secured directly on the device.

The purpose of this encryption is to combat the threat of the "harvest now, decrypt
later" approach used by malicious actors, who aim to gather and decrypt sensitive
data at some point in the future.
